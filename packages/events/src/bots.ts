 * Open and click classification.

 * Since Apple Mail Privacy Protection shipped, a raw open rate is not a
 * measurement of anything — MPP pre-fetches every image for every message
 * whether or not the recipient looks at it, and it accounts for a large share
 * of consumer mail. Security scanners do the same to links.
 *
 * The approach here is: classify at the edge, store everything, and default the
 * charts to `human`. Nothing is discarded, because a customer investigating a
 * specific message needs to see the scanner hit too — but a headline "open
 * rate" that silently includes MPP is a number that cannot be reasoned about,
 * and this product's whole argument is about not shipping those.
