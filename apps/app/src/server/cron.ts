 *
 *   This account has reached the Workers Free limit of 5 cron triggers per
 *   account [code: 10072]
 *
 * The hourly schedule did nothing at all — `SegmentActor` arms its own alarm —
 * and the daily one is a once-a-day task that the minute tick can perfectly
 * well notice is due. So the deployment declares `* * * * *` and nothing else,
 * and this decides what that tick owes.
 *
 * `cron` is still the parameter, because the Node runtime and the Workers
 * runtime both have one, and an instance deployed before this change still has
 * the old schedules attached until its next deploy — every one of them lands
 * here and does the right thing.
