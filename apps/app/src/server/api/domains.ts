/**
 * `/v1/domains` — the setup screen behind every first send.
 *
 * Two decisions shape this file. First, the DKIM keypair is minted here and the
 * private key never leaves the row: a customer who can re-read their signing key
 * has a key that can be leaked, and there is no operation that needs it outside
 * the send path. Second, the DNS record set is the *union* of what every
 * configured provider requires, tagged per provider — a workspace that fails
 * over from Cloudflare to SES mid-incident must already have SES's records in
 * place when it is not bound to one transport — and discovering that at failover
 * time is discovering it too late. A domain that names a `provider` gets that
 * transport's records and nothing else, because a union of two transports each
 * wanting an apex `v=spf1` is two apex SPF records, which is a permanent error.
