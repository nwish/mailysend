 * hot chart layer: fast, approximate, sampled under load, three months of
 * retention. `rollups_daily` is the count of record: written once per event by
 * the consumer, never sampled, kept for as long as the deployment keeps its
 * database.
 *
 * Every endpoint here reads the count of record. A dashboard number that
 * disagrees with the invoice — or with what the customer told their own
