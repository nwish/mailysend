          You have an order to work in rather than a list of tips: settle authentication from the
          header, then look at your complaint and unknown-user rates, and only then argue about the
          subject line. The thing most likely to waste your week is skipping to the last step,
          because content is the only layer where you cannot measure whether a change helped —
          rewriting an email until it feels less spammy is unfalsifiable work, and the rate that
          actually moved your placement was the handful of recipients per thousand who pressed the
          spam button.

              Reputation is a rolling summary of how recipients behaved towards your mail, kept
              per-domain and per-IP by each receiver, and never shown to you. There is no score to
              look up, no appeal, and no lever. There is only the behaviour that produces it, which

              Domain reputation is the one that matters most now, and it travels with you: changing

              Content is last because it is the layer with the worst ratio of effort to certainty.
              Per-word scoring — the “spam words” lists, the idea that writing <em>free</em> or{' '}
              <em>guarantee</em> in a subject line trips a filter — has not been the dominant signal
              for many years. Filters are trained on sender behaviour and recipient reaction, and a
              sender with a clean complaint rate can write <em>free</em> as often as they like.
            </Lede>
            <Takeaway>
              The content factors that still matter are structural rather than lexical: whether the
              message is shaped like ordinary mail, and whether the domains it points at are
              trustworthy.
