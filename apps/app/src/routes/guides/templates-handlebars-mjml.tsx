          You can now pick an engine on purpose rather than by default: the AST when a template
          needs to be edited by someone who is not you, handlebars when it is a string with names in
          it, MJML when you already have MJML and a build step, raw HTML when the body came from
          somewhere else and must not be touched. The thing most likely to bite you is that{' '}
          <Mono>{'{{{value}}}'}</Mono> escapes exactly like <Mono>{'{{value}}'}</Mono> here. That is
          a deliberate divergence from upstream handlebars, it is documented rather than discovered,
          and a warning is emitted so you find out from the render result instead of from a

              Everything that renders a message — the send path, broadcast fan-out, the dashboard
              preview — calls one function, <Mono>renderTemplate</Mono>, and nothing else. That is
              not tidiness for its own sake: it is the only way a template can be guaranteed to
              render identically in the preview you approved and in the broadcast that goes out an
              hour later. Two code paths would eventually be two behaviours.

              Parsed templates are cached in a map keyed by the template source, bounded at
              sixty-four entries, evicting oldest-first — bounded because a Worker isolate is shared
              across workspaces, and an unbounded map keyed by customer-controlled text is a memory
              leak with an attacker-supplied key. A broadcast renders the same body once per
              recipient and parsing is by far the most expensive part of that loop, so the cache
              turns an O(recipients) parse cost into O(1). Generating a slightly different source
              string per recipient — splicing a name into the template rather than passing it as
              data — defeats the cache completely, and is the difference between one parse and a

            <Callout title="THE MERGE PASS RUNS AFTER COMPILATION, NOT BEFORE">
              MJML output is ordinary HTML that may still carry merge tags, so handlebars runs on
              the compiled result rather than on the source. The order is forced: MJML’s own parser
              chokes on a <Mono>{'{{#if}}'}</Mono> wrapped around an <Mono>{'<mj-column>'}</Mono>,
              because that is not valid MJML. Write conditionals around the HTML MJML produces, not
              around MJML’s own tags.
