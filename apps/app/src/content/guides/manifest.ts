/**
 * The guides, as data.
 *
 * One entry per guide. `sections` drives three things at once — the table of
 * contents, the visible `<h2>`s, and the `TechArticle` JSON-LD — which is the
 * same invariant `DOC_SECTIONS` establishes for /docs: three surfaces that can
 * disagree if they are written down separately, so they are written down once.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS FILE MUST STAY PURE DATA. NO IMPORTS — not even `import type`.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `content/public-pages.ts` carries the full reasoning; the short version is
 * that vite.config.ts imports this through esbuild's config bundler, the
 * post-build scripts import it through `tsx`, and the app imports it normally.
 * Only relative specifiers with explicit extensions survive all three, and this
 * file needs none at all. `GuideMeta` is therefore declared locally rather than
 * built from `~/seo`'s types; the shapes are structural, so they stay mutually
 * assignable, and `seo/guide-head.ts` asserts that once where `~/` is legal.
 *
 * `published` and `updated` are string literals rather than computed dates, so
 * that prerendered HTML is byte-identical across builds — a JSON-LD block that
 * changes on every deploy is a diff nobody can review.
